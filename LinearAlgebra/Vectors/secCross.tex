Omit this section in a first draft.
Area of parallelogram. 
Geometric and algebraic definition of cross product.
Formula as a \(3\times 3\) determinant (although not used again until \S\ref{sec:feebh}, and not defined in general until Chap~\ref{ch:ddm}).
Properties.
Normal of plane and equations.
Area of parallelogram and volume of parallelepiped. 
\end{comment}


One can convert between a parametric equation of a plane, and an equation involving the normal vector.
In three dimensions we invoke the cross product.
Qualitatively different techniques are developed for higher dimensions.
